This codebase includes a basic e-commerce website with the following features:

* Home page
* Product list page
* Product detail page
* Cart page
* Checkout page
* Redux store for managing state
* Axios for making API requests
* Bootstrap for styling

Note that this is just a starting point, and you will need to customize and extend this codebase to fit your specific needs. Additionally, you will need to set up a backend API to handle API requests and store data.
